# Crypto Prediction Discord Bot Docs
## _You'd better be right..._
 A Discord bot that allows users to place 24-hour predictions on crypto assets. Currently supported assets are any assets on the Binance futures exchange. Assets that look like ``BTCUSDT``

- BTC
- ETH
- LINK
- XRP
- ...more

## Commands
The commands take advantage of the new discord slash commands instead of the traditional  

- ``/prediction`` is how place a prediction. Example: ``/prediction symbol:BTCUSDT direction:Up``
    - ``Symbol`` The symbol to place the prediction on. 
    - ``Direction`` The If you think the asset will gain or loss value in the next 24 hours. Up/Down
- ``/mystats`` Tells you how well you're doing. 

You start a command just like you are starting any message to a channel. Type a ``/`` then the name of the command. It will likely auto-complete for you.
